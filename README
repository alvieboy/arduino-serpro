 **** Installation instructions for SerPro ****

* For host installation of serpro, run "autogen.sh" and then "./configure", 
  as usual. Then run "make" and "make install".

* For arduino installation, run "makelib.sh" which will create a 
  "SerPro.tar.gz" file. Then extract this file into a subdirectory named 
  "libraries" inside your arduino sketchbook.
